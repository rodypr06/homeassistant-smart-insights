# üîí Security Considerations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Security Warning

**This is a client-side application that exposes API keys in the browser. This implementation is suitable for personal use and development environments but requires additional security measures for production deployment.**

## üö® Known Security Issues

### 1. API Key Exposure
- **Issue**: OpenAI API keys are embedded in the client-side JavaScript bundle
- **Risk**: API keys are visible to anyone who inspects the browser's network traffic or source code
- **Impact**: Potential unauthorized API usage and billing charges

### 2. Browser-side API Calls
- **Issue**: All API calls are made directly from the browser
- **Risk**: API keys and tokens are transmitted in plain text
- **Impact**: Credentials can be intercepted or misused

### 3. Environment Variables in Docker
- **Issue**: Environment variables are baked into the Docker image at build time
- **Risk**: Sensitive data persists in the image layers
- **Impact**: Credentials may be exposed if images are shared

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Recommendations

### For Development/Personal Use
1. **Use dedicated API keys** with limited quotas and permissions
2. **Monitor API usage** regularly for unexpected charges
3. **Rotate API keys** periodically
4. **Use local networks** when possible to limit exposure

### For Production Deployment
1. **Implement a backend proxy service** to handle API calls
2. **Use server-side environment variables** that are not exposed to clients
3. **Implement proper authentication** and authorization
4. **Use HTTPS** for all communications
5. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse

## üèóÔ∏è Recommended Production Architecture

```
[Browser] ‚Üí [Backend Proxy] ‚Üí [OpenAI API]
                ‚Üì
           [InfluxDB/HomeAssistant]
```

### Backend Proxy Benefits
- API keys remain server-side
- Request validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and quota management
- User authentication and authorization
- Audit logging and monitoring

## üîß Implementation Guidelines

### Backend Proxy Service (Recommended)
Create a backend service that:
1. Handles all external API calls
2. Validates user requests
3. Implements proper authentication
4. Manages API keys securely
5. Provides rate limiting

### Example Backend Endpoints
```
POST /api/query/process
POST /api/insights/generate
POST /api/insights/update
GET /api/homeassistant/entities
```

### Environment Variable Security
- Use secrets management systems (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
- Implement runtime secret injection
- Avoid embedding secrets in container images
- Use encrypted environment variable files

## üö® Current Mitigations

This application includes several security measures:

1. **Environment Validation**: Validates API key formats and required variables
2. **Error Handling**: Prevents sensitive data leakage in error messages
3. **Input Validation**: Sanitizes user inputs before API calls
4. **Retry Logic**: Implements exponential backoff to prevent API abuse
5. **Security Warnings**: Clear warnings about API key exposure

## üìã Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Review all environment variables for sensitive data
- [ ] Implement backend proxy service (production)
- [ ] Set up proper authentication and authorization
- [ ] Configure HTTPS/TLS encryption
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and monitoring
- [ ] Set up API key rotation procedures
- [ ] Review and test error handling
- [ ] Implement audit logging

### Ongoing Security
- [ ] Monitor API usage and costs
- [ ] Regularly rotate API keys and tokens
- [ ] Review access logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Perform security audits
- [ ] Monitor for data breaches

## üÜò Incident Response

If you suspect a security breach:

1. **Immediately rotate** all API keys and tokens
2. **Review** API usage logs for unauthorized access
3. **Monitor** billing for unexpected charges
4. **Update** all affected credentials
5. **Investigate** the source of the breach
6. **Implement** additional security measures

## üìû Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:
1. **Do not** create a public issue
2. **Email** security concerns to the maintainers
3. **Provide** detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **Allow** reasonable time for response and fixes
