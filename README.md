### Intelligent Automation Types

The system analyzes your entities and suggests **10 different automation categories**:

1. **üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí° Motion-Activated Lighting**
   - Detects motion sensors + lights in same area (e.g., `living_room_motion` + `living_room_lights`)
   - Creates area-specific lighting automation with smart timing

2. **üå°Ô∏èüè† Climate Presence Control**
   - Matches climate devices with presence sensors
   - Energy-saving temperature control when away/home

3. **üö™üîí Security Door/Window Alerts**

   - Night-time and away-from-home notifications

4. **üîê Automatic Lock Control**
   - Smart locks + presence sensors = auto-lock when leaving
   - Area-specific lock automation

5. **üåÖü™ü Smart Blinds/Covers**
   - Sun-based automation for covers and blinds
   - Energy efficiency through automated shading

6. **üíß‚ö†Ô∏è Water Leak Detection**
   - Emergency alerts for water/moisture sensors
   - Area-specific leak monitoring

7. **üî•üö® Smoke Detection Alerts**
   - Emergency fire safety automations
   - Automatic lighting activation during emergencies

8. **üå°Ô∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è Temperature-Based Climate Control**
   - Matches temperature sensors with climate devices in same area
   - Precise room-by-room temperature control

9. **üí®üíß Humidity Control**
   - Humidity sensors + exhaust fans = automatic ventilation
   - Prevents mold and improves air quality

10. **üåô‚ú® Goodnight Routine**
    - Multi-device bedtime automation
    - Lights off, doors locked, temperature adjusted

> üìñ **Detailed Documentation**: See [INTELLIGENT_AUTOMATIONS.md](INTELLIGENT_AUTOMATIONS.md) for comprehensive information about the intelligent automation system.

### How It Works

1. **Navigate to Analytics Dashboard** ‚Üí Automation Suggestions
2. **Review AI-generated suggestions** based on your devices
3. **Click "Create"** on any suggestion
4. **Customize the automation** (name, description, mode)
5. **Preview YAML configuration** before deployment
6. **Validate and deploy** directly to HomeAssistant

### Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Considerations:**

- Long-lived access tokens provide full HomeAssistant access
- Store tokens securely and never commit them to version control
- Consider using a dedicated HomeAssistant user for automation creation
- Review all automations before deployment
- The app validates configurations but cannot guarantee safety

### Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues:**
- Verify HomeAssistant URL is accessible from the app
- Check that the access token has admin privileges
- Ensure HomeAssistant API is enabled (default: enabled)

**Missing Entities:**
- The app will warn about missing entities during validation
- Update entity IDs in the customization step if needed
- Some suggestions may not apply to your specific setup

## üîí Security & Privacy

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING**: This is a client-side application that exposes API keys in the browser. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for detailed security considerations.

### Current Security Status
- **‚ö†Ô∏è API Key Exposure**: OpenAI API keys are visible in browser (development/personal use only)
- **‚úÖ Environment Validation**: Validates API key formats and required variables
- **‚úÖ Input Sanitization**: Validates and sanitizes user inputs
- **‚úÖ Error Handling**: Prevents sensitive data leakage in error messages
- **‚úÖ Local Data**: Your InfluxDB data stays in your infrastructure

### For Production Use
- **Implement a backend proxy service** to handle API calls securely
- **Use server-side environment variables** that are not exposed to clients
- **Implement proper authentication** and authorization
- **Use HTTPS** for all communications
- **See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** for comprehensive security guidelines
