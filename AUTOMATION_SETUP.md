# ü§ñ HomeAssistant Automation Creation Setup Guide

## Overview

The HomeAssistant Smart Insights application now includes **full automation creation capabilities** that allow you to:

- Generate AI-powered automation suggestions based on your devices
- Preview and customize automations with YAML validation
- Deploy automations directly to your HomeAssistant server
- Monitor connection status and handle errors gracefully

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Generate HomeAssistant Long-Lived Access Token

1. **Open HomeAssistant** in your browser
2. **Navigate to Profile** ‚Üí Click your profile picture in the bottom left
3. **Go to Security tab** ‚Üí Scroll down to "Long-Lived Access Tokens"
4. **Create Token** ‚Üí Click "Create Token" button
5. **Copy Token** ‚Üí Save the generated token securely (you won't see it again!)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# HomeAssistant configuration (used for both data visualization and automation creation)
VITE_HOMEASSISTANT_URL=http://192.168.1.100:8123
VITE_HOMEASSISTANT_TOKEN=your_long_lived_access_token_here
```

### 3. Verify Connection

1. **Start the application** (`npm run dev` or Docker)
2. **Navigate to Analytics Dashboard**
3. **Check Automation Suggestions card** for connection status
4. **Green dot** = Connected ‚úÖ | **Red dot** = Disconnected ‚ùå

## üéØ How to Create Automations

### Step 1: Browse Suggestions
- Navigate to **Analytics Dashboard** ‚Üí **Automation Suggestions**
- Review AI-generated suggestions based on your available devices
- Each suggestion shows:
  - **Priority** (High/Medium/Low)
  - **Category** (Energy/Security/Comfort/etc.)
  - **Impact** (estimated savings or benefits)
  - **Required entities** (devices needed)

### Step 2: Create Automation
1. **Click "Create ‚Üí"** on any suggestion
2. **Preview** the automation details and requirements
3. **Customize** the automation:
   - Change name and description
   - Modify execution mode (Single/Restart/Queued/Parallel)
   - Preview YAML configuration
4. **Validate** the automation:
   - Check for missing entities
   - Review warnings and errors
   - Ensure all requirements are met
5. **Deploy** to HomeAssistant:
   - Automation is created and activated
   - Automatic reload of HomeAssistant automations

### Step 3: Verify in HomeAssistant
1. **Go to HomeAssistant** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Automations & Scenes**
2. **Find your automation** in the list
3. **Test the automation** by triggering its conditions
4. **Monitor execution** in HomeAssistant logs

## üîß Supported Automation Types

### 1. Motion-Activated Lighting
**Detects:** Motion sensors + Light entities
**Creates:** Smart lighting that turns on with motion, off after delay
**Benefits:** 15-25% energy savings, convenience

**Example entities required:**
- `binary_sensor.motion_sensor_living_room`
- `light.living_room_lights`

### 2. Climate Presence Control
**Detects:** Presence sensors + Climate entities
**Creates:** Temperature adjustment when nobody's home
**Benefits:** $20-40/month energy savings

**Example entities required:**
- `person.john_doe` or `device_tracker.phone`
- `climate.main_thermostat`

### 3. Security Notifications
**Detects:** Door/window sensors
**Creates:** Alerts during specific hours (night/away)
**Benefits:** Enhanced security monitoring

**Example entities required:**
- `binary_sensor.front_door`
- `binary_sensor.window_sensor`

### 4. Energy Optimization
**Detects:** Smart switches, power monitoring
**Creates:** Automated device scheduling
**Benefits:** Reduced standby power consumption

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### Custom Entity Mapping
If the app doesn't detect your entities correctly, you can:

1. **Check entity names** in HomeAssistant ‚Üí Developer Tools ‚Üí States
2. **Ensure device classes** are set correctly:
   - Motion sensors: `device_class: motion`
   - Door sensors: `device_class: door`
   - Window sensors: `device_class: window`

### Automation Modes Explained

- **Single**: Only one instance runs at a time
- **Restart**: Restart automation if triggered while running
- **Queued**: Queue multiple instances (with max limit)
- **Parallel**: Run multiple instances simultaneously

### YAML Customization
The app generates standard HomeAssistant YAML that you can:
- Copy and paste into your `automations.yaml`
- Modify manually in HomeAssistant
- Use as a template for more complex automations

## üîí Security Considerations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes

1. **Token Security**:
   - Long-lived access tokens provide **full HomeAssistant access**
   - Store tokens securely, never commit to version control
   - Consider creating a dedicated user for automation creation

2. **Network Security**:
   - Ensure HomeAssistant is not exposed to the internet without proper security
   - Use HTTPS when possible
   - Consider VPN access for remote management

3. **Automation Review**:
   - Always review automations before deployment
   - Test in a safe environment first
   - Monitor automation behavior after deployment

### Best Practices

1. **Dedicated User**: Create a HomeAssistant user specifically for automation creation
2. **Token Rotation**: Regularly rotate long-lived access tokens
3. **Backup**: Export automations before making changes
4. **Testing**: Test automations in development mode first

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem**: Red connection indicator, "Connection Failed"
**Solutions**:
1. Verify HomeAssistant URL is correct and accessible
2. Check that HomeAssistant is running and responsive
3. Ensure access token has admin privileges
4. Test API access: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://your-ha:8123/api/`

### Missing Entities

**Problem**: "Some entities may not exist" warning
**Solutions**:
1. Check entity IDs in HomeAssistant ‚Üí Developer Tools ‚Üí States
2. Ensure devices are properly configured and online
3. Update entity IDs in the customization step
4. Some suggestions may not apply to your specific setup

### Automation Creation Fails

**Problem**: "Failed to create automation" error
**Solutions**:
1. Check HomeAssistant logs for detailed error messages
2. Ensure user has configuration write permissions
3. Verify YAML syntax is valid
4. Check for conflicting automation names

### API Timeout

**Problem**: Requests timeout or fail
**Solutions**:
1. Check network connectivity to HomeAssistant
2. Increase timeout in service configuration
3. Ensure HomeAssistant isn't overloaded
4. Try creating simpler automations first
